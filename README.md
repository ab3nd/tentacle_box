 # The Tentacle Box
 This repo contains files for a prop for a puzzle game. The prop is a crate with a Lovcrafitian monster escaping from it. 
 Most of the files are STL files to 3D print parts for the tentacles of the monster, or laser cut motor mounts to rotate the tentacles. 
 
 Tentacleconnector.stl is in inches, if it comes out really tiny, make it 25.4 times bigger.
